C++ String vs C Strings

Strings define objects that can be represented as string streams.	

The null character terminates a character array of characters.


No Array decay occurs in strings as strings are represented as objects.
	
The threat of array decay is present in the case of the character array.


A string class provides numerous functions for manipulating strings.	

Character arrays do not offer inbuilt functions to manipulate strings.


Memory is allocated dynamically.	

The size of the character array has to be allocated statically.
